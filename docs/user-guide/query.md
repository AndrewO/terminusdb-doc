# Query
{: .no_toc }

WOQL is the query language that works with TerminusDB. With its Prolog like logic, it is an elegant way to query data when you get the hang of it.

WOQLâ€™s primary syntax and interchange format is in JSON-LD. However, you can use WOQLjs and WOQLpy package which is included in their corresponding API client to construct WQOL queries. Query using WOQLjs and WOQLpy is also available in TerminusDB console.

# WOQL - Web Object Query Language

The WOQL query language is a unified model query language. It allows us to treat our database as a document store or a graph interchangeably, and provides powerful query features which make relationship traversals easy.

WOQL's primary syntax and interchange format is in JSON-LD. This gives us a relatively straightforward human-readable format which can also be easily stored in TerminusDB itself.

For example a simple query which allows us to retrieve all documents in the database, along with their labels and types:

```json
{"@context" : {"@import": "https://terminusdb/contexts/woql/syntax/context.jsonld",
               "@propagate": true,
               "db" : "http://localhost:6363/testDB004/"}, "from" : [ "db:main",
     {"select" : [ "v:Object", "v:Class", "v:Class_Label", "v:Label", "v:Type",
          {"and" : [{"triple" : ["v:Object", "rdf:type", "v:Class"] },
                    {"sub" : ["v:Class", "dcog:Entity"] },
                    {"eq" : ["v:Type", {"@value" :"Entity", "@type" : "xsd:string"}]},
                    {"quad" : ["v:Class", "rdfs:label", "v:Class_Label", "db:schema"]},
                    {"opt" : [{"triple" : ["v:Object", "rdfs:label", "v:Label"]}]}
                   ]}
                 ]}
          ]}
```

# WOQL JSON-LD Encoding

The default imported JSON-LD context at [https://terminusdb/contexts/woql/syntax/context.jsonld](https://terminusdb/contexts/woql/syntax/context.jsonld) allows the syntax to be less verbose by automatically adding "@id" to each of the syntactic elements and providing a default WOQL base URI. For example:

```json

{"@context" :
{
    "@version": 1.1,
    "@vocab": "http://terminusdb.com/woql#",
    "rdf" : "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#",
    "rdfs" : "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#",
    "dcog" : "https://datachemist.net/ontology/dcog#",
    "v" : "http://terminusdb.com/woql/variable/",
    "select" : {"@type" : "@id"},
    "from" : {"@type" : "@id"},
    "and" : {"@type" : "@id"},
    "triple" : {"@type" : "@id"},
    "eq" : {"@type" : "@id" },
    "sub" : {"@type" : "@id" },
    "opt" : {"@type" : "@id"}
    ...
 }
}
```

# WOQLjs and WOQLpy

JSON, through an elegant way to pass queries to the database, it is not the most coding friendly. WOQLjs and WOQLpy provide a tool to construct WOQL queries with JavaScript and Python. They are included in their corresponding API client to construct WQOL queries. Query using WOQLjs and WOQLpy is also available in TerminusDB console. For details about WOQLjs and WOQLpy calls, please see the documentation of the API clients:

[JavaScript Client](https://terminusdb.github.io/terminus-client/){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }[Python Client](https://terminusdb.github.io/terminus-client-python/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

We assume most users will use WOQLjs or WOQLpy when constructing queries, hence most examples in this documentation will be in WOQLjs and/or WOQLpy.

# Creating Schema

When creating a schema with WOQL, a `when` cause is used, it takes two arguments: the first argument is the condition that need to full fill to execute the second argument. With WOQLjs and WOQLpy, you may chain the executable query following `WOQL.when()` (in WOQLjs) or `WOQLQuery.when()` (in WQQLpy). In most cases in creating a schema, a condition is not required and thus the first argument will be `true`. for example in WOQLjs:

```js
WOQL.when(true).and(
    WOQL.doctype("Station")
        .label("Bike Station")
        .description("A station where bicycles are deposited"),
    WOQL.doctype("Bicycle")
        .label("Bicycle"),
    WOQL.doctype("Journey")
        .label("Journey")
        .property("start_station", "Station")
            .label("Start Station")
        .property("end_station", "Station")
            .label("End Station")
        .property("duration", "integer")
            .label("Journey Duration")
        .property("start_time", "dateTime")
            .label("Time Started")
        .property("end_time", "dateTime")
            .label("Time Ended")
        .property("journey_bicycle", "Bicycle")
            .label("Bicycle Used")
)
```

### Document objects

The executable queries can be constructed with the help of the WOQL query objects. Usually there document objects with labels and descriptions can be easily constructed with a chain of call like:

``` js
WOQL.doctype("Station")
    .label("Bike Station")
    .description("A station where bicycles are deposited")
```

However, labels and descriptions are optional. The minimum way of creating a document object would be `WOQL.doctype("idOfObj")`

### Properties

Properties can also be chained to the document objects in WOQLjs and WOQLpy, for example in WOQLjs:

``` js
WOQL.doctype("Journey")
    .label("Journey")
    .property("start_station", "Station")
        .label("Start Station")
```

Properties will take an extra argument for the range of the property - it could be a datatype e.g. dateTime, string, integer, double, etc; or an other document object. label and descriptions can also be added to properties in similar manner as doctype objects.

### Subclases

To created a subclass structure in TerminusDB graph,`add_quad` can be used. For example:

``` js
WOQL.add_quad("child", "subClassOf", "parent", "schema")
```
