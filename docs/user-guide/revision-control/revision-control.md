# Revision Control
{: .no_toc }

One of the most unique aspects of TerminusDB is that it provides the full suite of revision control opertions on entire databases, or any subdivision of them. This means that you can clone entire databases from any other terminusDB server (as long as you have permissions to do so).  You can create branches of databases, schemas or data and merge them together in a controlled way and easily share the results with your decentralised collaboration team.
